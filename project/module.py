# module.py (or other module files)

# Purpose: Contains reusable functions, classes, or logic.
# How to Use:
# - Keep your code modularâ€”split logic into files by topic or feature.
# - For example, you might have data_loader.py, models.py, plotting.py, etc.

# Example Code
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
